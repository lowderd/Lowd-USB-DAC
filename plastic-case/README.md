# Lowd-USB-DAC 3d printer case

- I designed a new plastic case for the Lowd-USB-DAC project,
mostly because I didn't like the original case.

## Instructions

This plastic case is made of 2 parts, one base and a cover
for the base, and to stick them together 3mm screws are used.

Once the bottom part and the top are printed, the holes on the
top of the case should be threaded; using a 3mm tap. In order to
this operation the original size of these holes is 2.5mm.
This must be done in order to insert the flat head 3mm screw
and keep the base and the top together.

I made this out of plastic because is cheaper and faster than
using a CNC to make a aluminum case. The obvious problem is
the lack of electromagnetic shielding. But, I am currently
thinking on painting the case using carbon conductive paint, the
same kind of paint used to shield electric guitars.

If you want to modify my case you are free to do it, so the
original blend file is also included.

Also, I have to mention that the orginal case height was increased.
This due the size of C10 and C11 capacitors were bigger and taller
than the original ones. If you use shorter C10, C11 capacitors
it will be good to modify the 3D model and make it shorter, in order
to save money in plastic.

The files included are:

- case-base.stl   (stl file ready to print the case's bottom)
- case-top.stl (stl file ready to print the case's top)
